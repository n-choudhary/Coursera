   <h1>Quantum Free Electron Theory of Metal</h1>

    <p>Metals in general have high electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, luster and density, and the ability to be deformed under stress without cleaving.  While there are several metals that have low density, hardness, and melting points, these are extremely reactive and are rarely encountered in their elemental metallic form. Let’s us see some of the characteristic features of metals.

      <p>We can readily explain several of the important physical properties of metals in terms of free electron gas.  The motion of the free electrons is responsible for the high electric conductivity of metals.  Accordingly, the free electrons are often called conduction electrons.   One of the first calculations of the conductivity of a free-electron gas was made by Paul Drude in 1900.

      <p>Electrical conductivity is strongly dependent on temperature. In metals, electrical conductivity decreases with increasing temperature. Experimentally, electrical conductivity σ is inversely proportional to the temperature T
