          Quantum Free Electron Theory
      </h2>
       <p> Sommerfeld proposed this theory in 1928 retaining the concept of free electrons moving in a  uniform potential within the metal as in the classical theory, but treated the electrons as obeying the laws of quantum mechanics. Based on the deBroglie wave concept, he assumed that a moving electron behaves as if it were a system of waves. (called matter waves-waves associated with a moving particle). According to quantum mechanics, the energy of an electron in a metal is quantized. He realised the role played by Pauli exclusion principle in restricting the energy values of electron. The theory proposed known as Quantum Free Electron Theory.  The main assumptions of quantum free electron theory are

          Fermi Energy
      </h2>
       <p> Due to the quantization rules, a material in solid state possess a set of allowed energy levels. For a metal containing N free electrons, there will be N such allowed energy levels, which are separated by energy differences that are characteristic of the material. The allowed energy  values for the conduction electrons in the metal are also quantised, are related to the energy levels of the metal. As per the Pauli exclusion principle, each energy level can accommodate a maximum of two electrons, one with spin up and the other one with spin down

          Fermi Factor
        </h2>
         <p> When the temperature is not at absolute zero, the material will be receiving thermal energy from surroundings. At ordinary temperature, the amount of energy will be quite small‚Äù,  because of which the electrons occupying energy levels below the Fermi level cannot absorb the thermal energy. It is because, there is no availability of unoccupied higher energy levels into which the electron can come into, due to the increase in energy by the absorption of thermal energy. However, there are unoccupied higher energy levels which are above the occupied energy levels at small energy differences. They are located near Fermi level. Those are the energy levels into which, the electrons in the energy levels near Fermi level, are capable of being excited.
